Project Description: In this project, we will guide you through the process of hosting your personal website on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance. By setting up an EC2 instance, configuring a web server, and deploying your website, you'll be able to showcase your work, portfolio, or interests on the internet.

Technologies Used:

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): We will create a virtual server instance in the cloud using EC2. This instance will serve as the hosting environment for your website.

Web Server (e.g., Apache, Nginx): We will set up a web server software to serve your website's HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, and any other assets.

Domain Name: You will need a registered domain name that you can associate with your EC2 instance's IP address.

SSH (Secure Shell): SSH will be used to securely connect to your EC2 instance and manage files and configurations remotely.

Security Groups: AWS security groups will be configured to control inbound and outbound traffic to your EC2 instance, ensuring security.


Conclusion :

By hosting your personal site on an AWS EC2 instance, you have gained valuable experience in setting up and managing web hosting environments. You've learned how to provision a virtual server, configure a web server, and make your content accessible on the internet. This project also provides insights into cloud-based infrastructure and website deployment.


Future Scope:

HTTPS and SSL/TLS: Enhance security by setting up HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt the communication between the user's browser and your website.

Database Integration: Integrate a database, such as Amazon RDS, to store dynamic content or user interactions on your website.

Load Balancing: Implement a load balancer if your site's traffic increases significantly, distributing it across multiple instances for improved performance.

Continuous Deployment: Set up a continuous deployment pipeline using tools like AWS CodePipeline to automate updates and deployments.

Serverless Components: Consider integrating serverless components for specific features, such as contact forms or commenting systems.

Monitoring and Scaling: Utilise AWS CloudWatch to monitor your instance's performance and scale resources as needed to accommodate traffic spikes.
